PatchQ=There is a patch for "%s". Do you want to apply it?
Ignore=Ignore
MapperNotSupported=Sorry, "%s" uses mapper #%d, which is not supported by the NES Mini's built in emulator. However, it will probably work with external emulator mods. Continue?
FourScreenNotSupported=Sorry, %s uses four-screen mode (the game had additional VRAM in the cartridge), and this feature is not supported by the NES/SNES Mini. The game will probably not start. It should work if a different emulator module is installed. Do you want to add this game anyway?
Need3rdPartyEmulator=Oops, it seems like "%s" is not going not work correctly with the original emulator. Do you want to use a 3rd party emulator for this game (it needs to be installed)?
